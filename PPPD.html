            <h1>What is PPPD?</h1>
            <p>PPPD stands for Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PPPD has a specific set of symptoms.</li>
                <li>PPPD can be related to many ohter conditions.</li>
                <li>PPPD can be treated.</li>
                <li>PPPD is not all in your head.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Ask your healthcare provider any questions you have about this information or about your dizziness.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Light-headed</li>
                <li>Foggy-headed</li>
                <li>Heavy-headed</li>
                <li>Cloudy-headed</li>
                <li>Cotton-headed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                “Dizziness” may be a feeling that your balance is just not as good as it used to be. “Unsteadiness”
                refers to a sensation of swaying or rocking that you get when you sit or stand. Unsteadiness might also
                be a sensation of veering off to the side when walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Vertigo” is a feeling of spinning or tilting suddenly. Vertigo is not part of PPPD although some people
                have PPPD along with other conditions that cause vertigo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persistent-postural-perceptual dizziness or PPPD is defined as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A feeling of dizziness or unsteadiness that you have most of the time</li>
                <li>You have this sensation almost every day</li>
                <li>This sensation has lasted at least three months</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some things may make your PPPD worse:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your own movement</li>
                <li>Movement of things around you</li>
                <li>Busy stores</li>
                <li>Social gatherings</li>
                <li>Traffic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                “Visually demanding” things may also make your PPPD worse. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Working on the computer</li>
                <li>Watching TV</li>
                <li>Playing video games</li>
                <li>Walking on carpets with complex patterns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                PPPD can be related to other problems, or you can have it without having any related health problems.
                Either way, PPPD can be treated.
            </p>
            <h2>Posible Triggers</h2>
            <p>
                The exact cause of PPPD is not yet known. However, it often starts after one of these problems:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A vestibular or balance disorder that affects the inner ear or brain.</li>
                <li>Vestibular migraine – a type of migraine headache that causes vertigo or dizziness.</li>
                <li>Anxiety that causes dizziness or lightheadedness.</li>
                <li>A concussion.</li>
                <li>Autonomic disorders that cause fainting spells, near faints or dizziness.</li>
                <li> Other medical problems that cause dizziness such as heart rhythm problems.</li>
                <li> Side effects of some medicines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                Treatments for PPPD include both physical therapy and medications which can be used alone or together.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your PPPD is related to another condition, like migraine or anxiety, that condition should also be
                treated.
            </p>

            <h2>Physical Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                The kind of physical therapy used to treat PPPD is called habituation therapy or exposure therapy. This
                therapy exposes you gradually to things that seem to cause your dizziness or make it worse. The idea is
                that repeated, brief exposure to these things will help you build up a tolerance to them, reducing your
                dizziness.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will have a treatment plan and be asked to work through it at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                It may take a few weeks to see significant improvement and at least 8 to 12 weeks to get the best
                results from your exercise program.
            </p>
            <h2>Medications</h2>
            <p>
                Two groups of medications used to treat PPPD include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These medications are often used to treat
                    depression and anxiety but seem to work in treating PPPD. Even if you are not depressed or anxious,
                    SSRIs may help reduce your dizziness a lot.</li>
                <li>Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. These medications are also used to treat
                    depression and anxiety. Even if you do not have a psychiatric illness, they can help reduce your
                    dizziness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Self Care</h2>
            <p>
                Take your medications as prescribed. Don’t stop taking them without talking to your health care
                provider.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things you can do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow your treatment plan, including your home exercises.</li>
                <li>Take your medications as your healthcare provider tells you to.
                    Never stop taking medications without talking to your health care provider.</li>
                <li> As you recover, pace yourself. Take breaks from activity as needed.</li>
                <li>Don’t limit your activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>Is PPPD a psychiatric illness?</h3>
            <p>
                No, PPD is not a psychiatric disorder. But behavioral changes can sometimes help. For that reason, you
                may see a behavioral medicine specialist.
            </p>
            <h3>Why do I have PPPD?</h3>
            <p>
                We don’t really know why people get PPPD. If you had a related condition, such as, for example, an inner
                ear infection that gave you vertigo, you may have gotten more sensitive to your own movement and
                balance. This sensitivity may contribute to your PPPD.
            </p>
            <h3>Will I get better?</h3>
            <p>
                About four out of five people get better with treatment. Even if your dizziness doesn’t go away
                completely, treatment may improve it quite a bit.
            </p>
            <h3>How long do I need treatment?</h3>
            <p>
                Usually the initial period is from 8 to 12 weeks, for both physical therapy and medications. Your
                treatment plan may last for a year or more.
            </p>
            <h3>Do the medications cause side effects?</h3>
            <p>
                SSRIs and the SNRIs may cause side effects. Ask your doctor and pharmacist about possible side effects.
                You may see dizziness listed as a possible side effect of these medications. However, that doesn’t refer
                to the type of dizziness caused by PPPD. Rarely is PPPD made worse by SSRIs or SNRIs.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I be sure that PPPD is what I have?</h3>
            <p>
                Research studies show that if you fit the criteria for PPPD describes in the first section of this
                material and have had a complete evaluation, it is not likely that other diagnoses have been missed.
