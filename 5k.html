            <h1>3rd Annual 5K for PPPD Awareness</h1>
            <p><em>Date: Saturday, July 13th, 2019</em></p>
            
            <p> The HERO Club hosted its 3rd annual
                5k this year on July 13th. We raised
                over $11,000 and had over 150 people in attendance.
            </p>

            <p> Congrats to our winners Anthony Goodrich and Isabella Rojo,
                who ran a 19:16 and 25:51 respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are very thankful for all our volunteers and sponsors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diamond Sponsors – UST Global</li> 
                <li>Platinum Sponsors – McDonald & McDonald Attornies</li>
                <li>Food Sponsors – Fresh Market, Chipotle</li>
                <li>Water Sponsors – Drug Mart</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once again, thanks to everyone who came. We wouldn’t have 
                been able to do this without everyone’s support.
            </p>

            <h1>2nd Annual 5K for PPPD Awareness</h1>
            <p><em>Date: Saturday, July 24th, 2018</em></p>
            <p> We are very thankful to everyone that came to the run. The event 
                was a huge success. We had about 150 runners and walkers who participated 
                in the race. Looking back, it’s very surreal that it’s already been almost
                a year since the first annual The HERO Club 5k and that we’ve already completed 
                the second one. We are very grateful to all the support and contributions we got 
                from the volunteers, sponsors, donors, and runners. So once again, thanks to each 
                and everyone of you.
            </p>

            <p> We also had dazzling singers Danielle Ullman, Mckenzie Stewart, Gabe De Guia, 
                Priyanka Yenugu and Shelby Sansom from the MELODY WALLACE VOICE STUDIO, who 
                entertained the crowd with their mesmerizing voice and songs.
            </p>

            <p><em>Date: Saturday, July SOMETHING, 2017</em></p>
            <p>
                We raised $11,500 & had over 200 registrants. We want to deeply thank all of our sponsors and volunteers for 
                their support and contribution from the bottom of my heart. We are unable to express my gratitude in words.
                We can’t believe we were able to accomplish something this big in our first endeavor. Let’s hope we can keep
                it up and continue the success next year.
            </p>
