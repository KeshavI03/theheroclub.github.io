                <p>
                    The "Hero Club” is a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit that raises awareness
                    and funds for research on rare neurological and vestibular conditions.
                    We host a variety of fun events for the whole family. Profits from all
                    of these events are given to industry leading hospitals so they can continue
                    their research and hopefully develop cures for the conditions many people face.

                <p>
                    “The Hero Club” is the brainchild of Pranav Yenugu and Amogh Iyanna.
                    It started out from the passion of two students from Mason Middle
                    School who loved (and still do!) to help others. Each was inspired by
                    their own interest and experience to give back to the community. They
                    started off by organizing some volunteer events for “Hands against Hunger.”
                    After participating and working with Mason Middle School on several successful
                    events, Pranav wanted to take the idea above and beyond school boundaries. He
                    decided to extend his help to everyone in the community by “Helping Everyone Reach Out”.

                <h1>The Story of Our Founder,</h1>
                <h2>Pranav Yenugu</h2>
                <p>
                    From a very young age, my parents taught me and my sister the value of giving, be it family,
                    community
                    or neighborhood.
                    We learned to always give without expecting anything in return. While others might have spent their
                    time
                    playing games,
                    we worked hard at volunteering. And we loved it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being honest, I never truly understood what all the
                    fuss was about. I
                    was just like any other kid. Carefree, fun-loving, always playing games, and not worried about
                    anything,
                    especially the
                    future. But one year, when I was 10 years old, an unexpected thing happened in my family. My mom was
                    suddenly hospitalized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all started when we went on a trip to the Smoky Mountains. A few days after our trip, she was hit
                    with a massive vertigo
                    attack while she was at work. She also started experiencing flu-like symptoms. After 15-20 days of
                    antibiotic treatment,
                    several tests were done by ENT specialists and neurologists to find the root cause of her condition.
                    My
                    mom slowly became
                    less and less mobile, and on top of this, began to lose sensation in her hands and legs. Within a
                    day or
                    two, she was hospitalized
                    and was diagnosed with viral encephalitis, a condition that affects your central nervous system. She
                    became totally paralyzed for almost a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hit me very hard. My mother is a very influential person in my life, and I felt almost lost
                    without
                    her guidance.
                    I remember when she finally came back from rehab, in a wheelchair. My mom had to relearn how to walk
                    again along with several other things.
                    The entire process was very tough for me and my family, but we persevered, completely changing our
                    lifestyle along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mom’s determination to be back on her legs is definitely what encouraged me to carry on. She just
                    never gave up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As many people know, losing someone important to you, or someone who you love is hard, and sends
                    many
                    people into depression.
                    But losing your own self, that’s the harshest and toughest of them all. The fact that she didn’t
                    feel
                    sorry for herself is amazing,
                    and has taught me a very important lesson: never give up, no matter how bleak the situation seems
                    because you can always find a way out with enough
                    patience and diligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Months turned into years, and we still didn’t know the reason why her condition
                    wasn’t stabilizing. My mom continued her rehab
                    and medication and continued to visit several new doctors and hospitals, but nobody knew what was
                    happening. We were frightened out of our minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day by day, we waited to see what had happened and what we could do to fix if — it that was even
                    possible. My father was very determined to find a solution
                    for her condition. He took her to many hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic. Finally in 2016 —
                    after four long years — the Mayo Clinic in Rochester
                    identified that the viral encephalitis and the initial vestibular and balance disorder that my
                    mother
                    suffered from had affected her brain and led to a
                    condition called PPPD or 3PD (Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness). They had just discovered
                    and
                    defined the diagnosis and key symptoms for PPPD
                    in early 2014. The medication and treatment plan was developed later, around mid-2015. Furthermore,
                    as
                    per the information from the Mayo Clinic doctors,
                    PPPD is yet to be added to the ICD (International Classification of Diseases), and this was why no
                    doctors in Ohio knew about this condition.
                    Even within the entire United States, very few doctors knew what this condition was — the number of
                    them
                    could be counted on one’s fingers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this entire journey, I noticed how much our community has given our family. We never felt
                    left out of events or celebrations in the slightest.
                    Our relatives, friends, neighbors, well-wishers, my parents’ colleagues and everyone else we know in
                    the
                    community stood by us, and continue to help us in these hard times.
                    Everyone was morally supportive and continue to motivate us constantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mother’s friends still help out to this day: volunteering to drive my mother to her daily
                    appointments
                    and rehabs. All this kindness completely changed my perspective on life. I realized why my
                    grandparents
                    and family have always been active participants in the community, hosting
                    so many charity events and serving so many people in hardship. It sometimes surprised me the way
                    they
                    all worked together to help people in destitution and need. But after witnessing
                    firsthand some of the terrible things people around the world must go through, my belief in giving
                    has
                    been cemented, and in turn, has shaped me into a better person. It has bestowed upon me a new goal
                    that
                    I will continue to do throughout the rest of my life: Helping Everyone Reach Out.
